## Problem Statement :-

While the wine industry generally has been very proactive about dealing with climate change, from capturing fermentation carbon totrialling new varieties, this is

ultimately a political problem. To find an effective solution for this problem you were asked to help in ETL process.

Do ETL : Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me some information from this large data. This is form of data mining.

What all information can be achieved by mining this data, would bebrainstormed by the interns

Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.

### Steps :-
1.Connected Database with Power BI Desktop.

2.There were 13*30k datas and I have used all to create a meaningful dashboard.

3.Analyzed the tables and relations between the columns and found some meaningful relationship.

4.Data Cleaning using Power Query Editor with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

5.Developed an Interactive BI Dashboard / Report.

6.I have created other 5 documents and those are :- 

### 1.HLD( High Level Document)
The HLD focused on the below objectives:- • Present all of the design aspects and define them in detail. • Describe the user interface being implemented. • Describe the hardware and software interfaces. • Describe the performance requirements. • Include design features and the architecture of the project. • List and describe the non-functional attributes like: -Security. -Reliability. -Maintainability. -Portability. -Reusability. -Application compatibility. -Resource utilization. -Serviceability.

### 2.LLD ( Low Level Document)
The LLD focused on the below objectives:- • Problem Understanding. • Data Acquisition. • Data Pre-Processing and Exploratory Analysis. • Development of models. • Auditing accuracy and retrain if require. • Finalizing the model. • Dashboard report for important activities.

### 3.Architecture design document:-
Power BI Architecture & Its Components, Power BI deployment, Publish datasets and Reports from Power BI are described.

### 4.Wireframe document:-
Dataset information, Architecture description and Final revision are included.

### 5.PPT File:-
From the beginning of the project till the end of deployment, Every steps with pictures are described.

## Conclusion :-

1.Total sales of wines are 963.53k and total varities of wines are 470.
